Template project for NimForUE: https://github.com/jmgomez/NimForUE



NimForUE is Nim plugin for UE5 that provides native performance, hot reloading, and full interop between C++ and Blueprints. With this plugin, you can extend any UE class in Nim and then further extend it in Blueprint without restarting the editor. This allows for seamless integration with common UE workflows, allowing you to take advantage of the power of Nim in your UE projects.




## Getting Started in Windows:

Make sure you have Unreal Engine 5.1 installed and Nim 1.6.10 or above is in your path.

1. Clone the repository and its submodules:
```
git clone https://github.com/jmgomez/NimTemplate.git --recurse-submodules
```
2. Navigate to the NimForUE directory:
```
cd NimTemplate/Plugins/NimForUE
```
3. Set up the project using nimble:

```nimble setup```

This will build the project and all the necessary Nim files.

4. Open NimTemplate.uproject (or run `./nue starteditor`)

5. Click play, click into the viewport to control the character. You're all set!
